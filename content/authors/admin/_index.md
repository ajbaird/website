My research focuses on mathematical modeling of biological systems, specifically fluid-structure interaction, mathematical models in physiology, and dynamical system applications. At ARA, I am the principal investigator of the BioGears project, the Virtual Patient (BurnCare) project, and the BioGears follow-on effort. 

My doctoral work focused on fully coupled fluid-structure interactions in modeling the invertebrate valveless tubular heart and the integration of a cardiac muscle cell model. I spent a year at Duke University as a visiting professor studying re-absorption mechanisms of the kidney and blood cell  aggregation and  de-aggregation in  the  capillaries due to peristaltic  pumping  mechanisms.
