publication: BurnCare tablet trainer to enhance burn injury care and treatment

publication_short: 

abstract: Applied Research Associates (ARA) and the United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) have been developing a tablet-based simulation environment for burn wound assessment and burn shock resuscitation. This application aims to supplement the current gold standard in burn care education, the Advanced Burn Life Support (ABLS) curriculum. Subject matter experts validate total body surface area (TBSA) identification and analysis and show that the visual fidelity of the tablet virtual patients is consistent with real life thermal injuries. We show this by noting that the error between their burn mapping and the actual patient burns was sufficiently less than that of a random sample population. Statistical analysis is used to confirm this hypothesis. In addition a full body physiology model developed for this project is detailed. Physiological results, and responses to standard care treatment, are detailed and validated. Future updates will include training modules that leverage this model.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Burn physiology model and associated treatment protocols are detailed.
