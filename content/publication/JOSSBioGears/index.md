publication: BioGears, A C++ library for whole body physiology simulations
publication_short: 

abstract: BioGears is an open source, extensible human physiology computational engine that is designed to enhance medical education, research, and training technologies. BioGears is primarily written in C++ and uses an electric circuit analog to characterize the fluid dynamics of the cardiopulmonary system. As medical training requirements become more complex, there is a need to supplement traditional simulators with physiology simulations. To this end, BioGears provides an extensive number of validated injury models and related interventions that may be applied to the simulated patient. In addition, BioGears compiled libraries may be used for computational medical research to construct in-silico clinical trials related to patient treatment and outcomes. Variable patient inputs support diversity and specification in a given application. The engine can be used standalone or integrated with simulators, sensor interfaces, and models of all fidelities. The Library, and all associated projects, are published under the Apache 2.0 license and are made available through the public GitHub repository. BioGears aims to lower the barrier to create complex physiological simulations for a variety of uses and requirements.
