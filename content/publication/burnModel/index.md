publication: A Full-Body Model of Burn Pathophysiology and Treatment Using the BioGears Engine
publication_short: 

abstract: We have created a model of systemic burn pathophysiology by incorporating a mathematical model of acute inflammation within the BioGears Engine. This model produces outputs consistent with burns of varying severities and leverages existing BioGears functionality to simulate the effect of treatment on virtual patient outcome. The model performs well for standard resuscitation scenarios and we thus expect it to be useful for educational and training purposes.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Burn physiology model and associated treatment protocols are detailed.
