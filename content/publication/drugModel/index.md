abstract: BioGears is an open‐source, lumped parameter, full‐body human physiology engine. Its purpose is to provide realistic and comprehensive simulations for medical training, research, and education. BioGears incorporates a physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that is designed to be applicable to a diversity of drug classes and patients and is extensible to future drugs. In addition, BioGears also supports drug interactions with various patient insults and interventions allowing for a realistic research framework and accurate dose‐patient responses. This tutorial will demonstrate how the generic BioGears PK/PD model can be extended to a new substance for prediction of drug administration outcomes.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Overview of the BioGears pharmacology (PKPD) modeling framework with a tutorial on adding new a new drug to the library.
