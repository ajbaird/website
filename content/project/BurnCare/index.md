Burn injuries are a serious life-threatening injury to the warfighter in a combat zone. In Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom (OIF & OEF) burns comprised 5% of casualties evacuated from the battlefield. These injuries result in approximately a 4% mortality rate, but the compounding effects of the recovery can lead to life-long reductions in quality of life. Evacuation time from the battlefield to increasing levels of care decreases with increasing burn size, but during OIF and OEF evacuation time to the US Army Burn Center took on average 4 days for patients with burns of over 40 percent of their body. Compounding this evacuation time is the continuously evolving battlefield with increasing far forward disparate engagement zones. The DoD anticipates the future battlefield to consist of large-scale combat operations across multiple domains, with near peer adversaries resulting in a lack of air and ground superiority and significantly delayed evacuation to definitive care. This creates a need for more burn care training focused on prolonged settings. A patient with over 40 percent total body surface area (TBSA) burn is and will be in critical need of constant monitoring and resuscitation for at least the first 3 days following the event. If evacuation is denied or delayed for many hours a more diverse set of care providers, inexperienced with burn care, must be able to diagnose, treat, stabilize and continue care for a critically wounded burn patient.

In addition to systemic challenges, there are practical challenges to caring for burn patients. Casualties with burns involving greater than 20% TBSA require careful resuscitation in the first

24 to 48 hours after injury. However, the person initially treating the casualty (as well as the next several providers in the evacuation chain) will likely not be physicians or nurses who specialize in burn care and may not be familiar with proper resuscitation procedures. To mitigate the problem of inexperience, in 2006, the Burn Care clinical practice guideline (CPG) was developed by burn providers at the USAISR Burn Center and disseminated via the Joint Theater Trauma System, to provide recommendations for optimal care of patients burned while involved in combat operations. Improvement in patient outcomes has been demonstrated when providers adhere to guidelines and utilize the burn flow sheet, but repeated and specialized training is still needed [3, 21].

The unique physiological response exhibited by a patient with large surface area burns exemplifies need for specialized training at every level of patient care. Developed by the American Burn Association (ABA), the Advanced Burn Life Support (ABLS) Provider course prepares the care provider for the first 24 hours post burn injury.

ABLS is comprised of didactic presentations, case scenario hands-on practice, concluding with a written exam and practical hands-on skill test and is offered periodically by specialty trained ABLS Course instructors. (Reeves, p 1107). These courses have been shown to provide participants with improved understanding of the complex requirements of burn treatment and to be positively supplemented by high fidelity simulations, however, not nearly enough non-burn care clinicians, to include the military providers, are able to attend the course. For example, according to the ABA, only 245 clinicians in North Carolina had completed ABLS between 2000 and 2007. This is in contrast to the over 60,000+ nurses in critical or emergency medicine in the state. Participation in ABLS is vastly underwhelming and only demonstrates the need for more wide-spread, affordable, and easily accessible training.

Our intent is to provide a tablet-based burn care simulator which can augment ABLS or facilitate familiarization for providers and other members of the military medical team prior to and during deployment. Currently, BurnCare provides refresher training on determining burn size (TBSA burned). In the future, it will incorporate the BioGears engine, resulting in physiologically realistic burn care simulations and enhanced training experiences for the user. Future module updates will include burn resuscitation, escharotomy, and prolonged multi-trauma care.
